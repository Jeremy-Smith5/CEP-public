SAMPLE DATA FOR TESTING -- 
synthetic_cp_bounds.csv and synthetic_cp_events.csv are derived from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid's synthetic version 
of the Prescription Drug Event (PDE) dataset. They are formatted to serve as input for the various counting process scripts 
in this repo. THESE ARE NOT REAL DATA!
